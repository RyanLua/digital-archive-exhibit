  <h1>The Great Gatsby and the Harlem Renaissance</h1>
  <p>
    In it’s over 50 years, <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, has survived the test of time as an American
    classic. The novel was published and set in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roaring_Twenties">Roaring
      Twenties</a>, a time of great change in America. However, it
    fails to represent all voices of the 1920s, such as the voices of marginalized communities who were making
    historical progress and redefining the American Dream of this time. Learn about the Harlem Renaissance and how it
    provided African Americans with the right tools to overcome societal barriers and establish their roots in history
    and discover the side of the American Dream that Fitzgerald did not include in his novel.

  <h2>Understanding <i>The Great Gatsby</i></h2>

  <p>Before talking about the Harlem Renaissance, we need to understand <i>The Great Gatsby.</i> The book’s author, F.
    Scott Fitzgerald, is known for focusing on wealth, class struggles, and the idea of the American Dream and it is no
    different in this book. The main character, Jay Gatsby, works hard to become rich and win back his lost love, Daisy
    Buchanan. However, his dream is based on money and status, and in the end, he realizes that wealth does not bring
    true happiness or acceptance. Gatsby in the pursuit of his love, loses everything. The novel criticizes the idea
    that money alone can lead to success, but it mostly tells the story of wealthy white characters. While it does
    portray an accurate and believable life of the elite, it does not explore how people from different backgrounds,
    especially African Americans, experienced the American Dream during this time.</p>

  <h2>Dreams Denied by Color</h2>
  <p>Langston Hughes was a poet during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_Renaissance">Harlem
      Renaissance</a> and in the poem <i>Harlem</i>, he shows the pain being limited in his dreams because of his color.

    <p>
      What happens to a dream deferred?
    <blockquote>
      Does it dry up<br>
      like a raisin in the sun?<br>
      Or fester like a sore—<br>
      And then run?<br>
      Does it stink like rotten meat?<br>
      Or crust and sugar over—<br>
      like a syrupy sweet?<br>
      <br>
      Maybe it just sags<br>
      like a heavy load.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Or does it explode</i>
    </blockquote>
    </p>
  </fieldset>
  <p>The poem uses images like a “raisin in the sun” and “rotten meat” to show how ignored dreams can lead to
    frustration
    and anger. Here, Hughes warns that denying African Americans their dreams can cause deep pain and even social
    unrest. The
    poem shows that true progress means removing the barriers that stop Black people from reaching their full potential.

  <h2>Songs of Protest and Peace</h2>
  <p>“Strange Fruit” by Billie Holiday has it’s background as a powerful protest song against the brutal lynching of
    Black Americans. The song was written as a response to racial violence in the South.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>The lyrics describe “Black bodies swinging” from trees, showing the horror of lynching. The song exposes the
    reality that racism made the American Dream impossible for many Black people. “Strange Fruit” became an anthem for
    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement">Civil Rights Movement</a>, proving that progress
    required ending racial violence.</p>

  <h2>Diamonds in the Ruff</h2>
  <p>In the below photograph from James Augustus Van Der Zee, it shows Black success and dignity during the Harlem
    Renaissance. The
    photo shows a well-dressed Black couple standing in front of a luxury
    car, symbolizing success.

  <p>Despite racism, some African Americans found ways to achieve wealth and status. The
    photograph challenges stereotypes and shows that Black people were creating their own version of the American Dream.
  </p>

  <h2>Afterword</h2>
  <p>With 50 years to date and many more to come, The Great Gatsby does not fully represent the Roaring Twenties as it
    might have you think. This doesn't mean its a good read or should not be considered an American classic, but it just
    doesn't include unrepresented groups such as Black Americans which are covered here.</p>
