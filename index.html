  <h1>Celebrating 50 Years of The Great Gatsby with Its Truth</h1>
  <p>
    In it’s over 50 years, <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, has survived the test of
    time as an American classic. The novel was published and set in the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roaring_Twenties">Roaring Twenties</a>, a time of great change in America.
    However, the book mainly shows the
    lives of wealthy white people. It fails to represent all voices of the
    1920s, such as the voices of marginalized communities who were making
    historical progress and redefining the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream">American Dream</a>
    of this time. Learn about the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_Renaissance">Harlem Renaissance</a>
    and how it provided African Americans with the right tools to overcome
    societal barriers and establish their roots in history and discover the
    side of the American Dream that Fitzgerald did not include in his novel.

    Sources include Langston Hughes’s poem <i>Harlem</i> about dreams denied
    by racism, Claude McKay’s <i>The Barrier</i> and the deep racial divisions
    of the time, Billie Holiday’s song "Strange Fruit" made in reponse to the
    brutal lynching of Black Americans, and James VanDerZee’s photograph
    Couple in Raccoon Coats which capture Black pride and success.

  <p>
    Before talking about the Harlem Renaissance, we need to understand
    <i>The Great Gatsby.</i> The book’s author,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._Scott_Fitzgerald">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a>, is known for focusing on
    wealth, class struggles, and the idea of the
    American Dream and it is no different in this book. The novel criticizes
    the idea that money alone can lead to success, but it mostly tells the
    story of wealthy white characters. While it does portray an accurate and
    believable life of the elite, it does not explore how people from
    different backgrounds, especially African Americans, experienced the
    American Dream during this time.
  </p>

  <h2>Dreams Denied by Color</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langston_Hughes">Langston Hughes</a>
    was a poet during the Harlem Renaissance. This cultural movement aimed to
    celebrate Black life and protest injustice. In his poem <i>Harlem</i>,
    Hughes writes about the pain of having dreams put on hold because of race.
  </p>
  <fieldset>
    <legend><i>Harlem</i> by Langston Hughes (1951)</legend>
    What happens to a dream deferred?
    <blockquote>
      Does it dry up<br />
      like a raisin in the sun?<br />
      Or fester like a sore—<br />
      And then run?<br />
      Does it stink like rotten meat?<br />
      Or crust and sugar over—<br />
      like a syrupy sweet?<br />
      <br />
      Maybe it just sags<br />
      like a heavy load.<br />
      <br />
      <i>Or does it explode</i>
    </blockquote>
  </fieldset>
  <p>
    The poem uses images like a “raisin in the sun” (something dried up and
    wasted) and “rotten meat” (something spoiled) to show how delaying dreams
    can lead to sadness, frustration, and anger. Hughes suggests that denying
    African Americans their dreams due to prejudice is harmful and could lead
    to bigger problems (“Or does it explode?”). This show that for many Black
    Americans in the 1920s, systemic racism made even starting the dream
    difficult which is harshly different from what Fitzgerald portrays in his
    book and has you to believe. Not only was this dream difficult or blocked,
    it could be dangerous as well.
  </p>

  <h2>Songs of Protest and Peace</h2>
  <p>
    Music was a important factor to the Harlem Renaissance. While jazz
    celebrated Black culture, other songs directly addressed the harsh
    realities of racism. “Strange Fruit” by
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday">Billie Holiday</a>
    is a powerful protest song against the brutal lynching of Black Americans.
    The song was written as a response to racial violence in the South.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <figcaption>“Strange Fruit” by Billie Holiday (1939)</figcaption>
    <audio controls src="assets/strange-fruit.mp3"></audio>
  </figure>

  <p>
    The lyrics describe “Black bodies swinging” from trees, showing the horror
    of lynching. The “strange fruit” is the bodies of lynched victims hanging
    from trees. The song exposes the reality that racism made the American
    Dream not just impossible for many Black people, but dangerous and could
    cost Black Americans their lives. Instead of the safe and prosperous life
    that Gatsby and Daisy lived, Black Americans were living in fear of their
    lives. “Strange Fruit” became an anthem for the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement">Civil Rights Movement</a>, proving that progress
    required ending racial violence.
  </p>

  <h2>Diamonds in the Ruff</h2>
  <p>
    Despite the huge challenges, the Harlem Renaissance was also a time of
    Black achievement and pride. Photographer
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Van_Der_Zee">James Van Der Zee</a>, it shows Black success and dignity
    during the Harlem Renaissance. The
    photo shows a well-dressed Black couple standing in front of a luxury car,
    symbolizing success.
  </p>

    <figcaption>

    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    Despite racism, some African Americans found ways to achieve wealth and
    status. The photograph challenges stereotypes and shows that Black people
    were creating their own version of the American Dream. This photo
    represents the rare victories for Black Americans in which are not
    convered by <i>The Great Gatsby</i>.
  </p>

  <h2>Barriers to the American Dream</h2>
  <p>
    Another important writer of the Harlem Renaissance was
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_McKay">Claude McKay</a>. His
    poem <i>The Barrier</i> describes how racism prevents progress and
    personal relationships. McKay often wrote about racial injustice and the
    struggles of being Black in America.
  </p>
  <fieldset>
    <legend><i>The Barrier</i> by Claude McKay (1922)</legend>
    I must not gaze at them although<br />
    Your eyes are dawning day;<br />
    I must not watch you as you go<br />
    Your sun-illumined way;<br />
    <br />
    I hear but I must never heed<br />
    The fascinating note,<br />
    Which, fluting like a river reed,<br />
    Comes from your trembling throat;<br />
    <br />
    I must not see upon your face<br />
    Love’s softly glowing spark;<br />
    For there’s the barrier of race,<br />
    You’re fair and I am dark.<br />
  </fieldset>
  <p>
    The poem’s lines about racial separation, like “You’re fair and I am
    dark,” highlight how racism divides people. The poem shows how racism not
    only affects careers and rights but also personal connections and
    emotions. For African Americans, success wasn’t just about money, like
    Gatsby’s struggles with old vs. new wealth, it was about breaking down
    racial barriers in all parts of life.
  </p>

  <h2>Afterword</h2>
  <p>
    With 50 years to date and many more to come, The Great Gatsby does not
    fully represent the Roaring Twenties as it might have you think. This
    doesn’t mean its a good read or should not be considered an American
    classic, but it just doesn't include unrepresented groups such as Black
    Americans which are covered here. Learning about the Harlem Renaissance
    gives us a better picture of this important decade in American history.
