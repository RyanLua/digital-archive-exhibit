    <p>What happens to a dream deferred?</p>
    <blockquote>
      Does it dry up<br />
      like a raisin in the sun?<br />
      Or fester like a sore—<br />
      And then run?<br />
      Does it stink like rotten meat?<br />
      Or crust and sugar over—<br />
      like a syrupy sweet?<br />
      <br />
      Maybe it just sags<br />
      like a heavy load.<br />
      <br />
      <i>Or does it explode</i>
